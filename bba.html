                  Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA) is the world’s
                  other sought-after business course that integrates academic
                  rigor with real-life problem-solving approaches, which
                  ultimately equips the BBA graduates with the entrepreneurial
                  know-how to excel at business and management. The program
                  curriculum fuses business/ management theories with day-to-day

                  develop an awareness of ethically and socially responsible
                  business practices, henceforth becoming team leaders capable
                  of working effectively in a dynamic business world.

                  120-credit program structured and built to produce
                  middle-level managers/ business leaders. Equally competitive
                  with the existent courses within the national curricula at
                  universities here in Nepal, this Westcliff University degree
                  offered by PBS is an international degree, which adheres to a
                  global standard of curriculum to garner international
                  recognition while it still embraces local business/ managerial
                  values. The School believes this transnational fusion embodied
                  in the program produces human resources that not only cater to
                  the need of both the domestic and global markets but also
                  thrive individually and professionally.
                  <br />

                  skills in all phases of business including decision-making and
                  problem-solving capacities. Further, this undergraduate

                  organization. The program includes instruction in management
                  theory, human resource management and behavior, accounting,
                  and other qualitative methods, purchasing and logistics,
                  organization and production, and marketing and business

                  The PBS BBA is a 4-year, 120-credit program structured and
                  built to produce middle-level managers/ business leaders.
                  Equally competitive with the existent courses within the
                  national curricula at universities here in Nepal, this
                  Westcliff University degree offered by PBS is an international
                  degree, which adheres to a global standard of the curriculum
                  to garner international recognition while it still embraces
                  local business/ managerial values. The School believes this
                  transnational fusion embodied in the program produces human
                  resources that not only cater to the need of both the domestic
                  and global markets but also thrive individually and
                  professionally.
